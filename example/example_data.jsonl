Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. \n\nBarista Health\n\nNote: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.\n\nIf the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. \n\nExperiments with varying pressure\n\nPersonally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction.

{"id": "33", "body": "Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans.\n\nCoffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as \u201ccoffee solubles\u201d and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.\nTemperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205\u00b0F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.\nOn the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].\nWhere cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cflat\u201d due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.\nOxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn\u2019t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can\u2019t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don\u2019t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.\nTo note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee \u201cstrength\u201d is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.\n\n", "title": ""}

Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.\n\nIn terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.\n\nWater: Temperature and Chemistry\n\nYou have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.\n\nIn general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.\n\nBrewing [Extraction]\n\nBitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.\n\nDrip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. \n\nSCIENCE\n\nMuch of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. \n\nResearch has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.\n\nChlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.\n\nFurfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.\n\nMore Information\n\nCoffee Chemistry: Cause of Bitter Coffee\n\nCoffee Basics: The Difference Between Arabica and Robusta\n", "title": ""}

There's nothing wrong with it but I think it will be better in a couple of days. I find the aromatic qualities peak about 24-48 hours after roasting, but that may be because the off-gassing process is literally emitting the most fumes.\n\nHow the flavor changes\n\nSubjectively, I'd say the smell and taste change like this:\n\nDuring early roasting, there are wood and vegetable smells, like when you put green wood on a fire and it puts out a lot of moisture-filled steam and begins to smoke.\n\nToward the end of the roast, the smell is more from the browning/caramelization/Maillard reaction and smells kind of like burnt toast. Not really much like coffee.\n\nIf you grind and drink it immediately after roasting, it tastes like generic coffee,  with those toasty flavors foreground. Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.\n\nAfter 24 hours the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich \"amazing coffee\" aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.\n\nSome beans continue to change for several days after roasting. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  \n\nAnd that, when it comes down to it, is what matters.

{"id": "138", "body": "Basics\nDecaffeination (decaf) is the removal of caffeine from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1\u20132% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.\nIn the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.\nWant to know even more?\nAdvanced\nWell, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:\nSwiss Water process\nThe use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980.\nThis method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.\nCO2 process\nit is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.\nThe supercritical CO2 acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO2 is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO2 acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO2 returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO2 using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO2 is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.\nThere are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.\nSourced from https://en.wikipedia.org\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "140", "body": "\n\nOne reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.\nArabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.\nFrom a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.\nRobusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.\n\nAll of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.\nWhere you\u2019ll find it: Nowadays, it\u2019s not often you\u2019ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you\u2019re drinking instant coffee? Well, that\u2019s probably all Robusta\u2026 but you probably don\u2019t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That\u2019s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends \u2013 specifically Italian style blends. It is said to help improve the crema.\nOne thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it\u2019s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn\u2019t widely used or available.

For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be just right when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect.

Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; milk at 6.5. A typical higher-acid breakfast blend coffee might land somewhere around 4.7.

Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.\nOxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds.

You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top.\nThis is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't.\nThe Equipment\n\nAeropress\nScoop that came with the Aeropress\nUltra fine mesh filter\n\nThe Coffee\nThe beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.)\nI store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says it's the best bet for Trader Joe's coffee.)\nThe Water\nMelted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.\nThe Method\nI'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.\n\nSet up the Aeropress for inverted brewing.\nFor one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.\nSlowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a gooseneck kettle for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)\nStir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.\nPlace the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)\nPress. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.\n\nEdit:\nAs I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:\n\nMy results vary significantly. I think the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.\nI never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.\n\nEdit Redux:\nFor the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I mentioned below, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)\nThis half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and an app full of AeroPress recipes; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results here and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.\nEdit The Third:\nThe results are in: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of freshly ground beans and the mesh metal filter is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.\nHowever, the plot thickens. My colleague Robert asserts:\n\nNever had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter &gt;).\n...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).\n\nSo it would seem that:\n\nFreshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city\nCoffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town\n\nI'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.\n", "title": ""}

My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. \n\nI will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee. \n\nTL;DR: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.\n\n\n\nDifferences by Region\n\n\n\nBased on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! \n\nNow, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! \n\n\n\nGreen Processing\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. \n\nWashed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. \n\n\n\nAge of the Coffee\n\n\n\nIf you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. \n\nThis plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. \n\n\n\nLevel of Roast\n\n\n\nThis graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. \n\nYou should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered \"French\" or \"Italian\" or even \"Spanish\" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible. \n\n\n  The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the\n  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still\n  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don\u2019t\n  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. \n  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad\n  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and\n  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

{"id": "194", "body": "Cold Brew Coffee - A Brief look at Flavor Profiles\n\nMy company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with data.\n\nIt has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! \n\nSo what is the full story? Read on! \n\n\n\nAcidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee\n\n\n\nThese two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average more acidic than its cold brewed counter part. \n\n\n\nDifferences in Average Flavor Profile\n\nBut what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? \n\nNo. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. \n\nFor this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  \n\nLet's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: \n\nFull Immersion Cold Brew Coffee\n\nThis is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. \n\nFull Immersion Hot Brew Coffee\n\nThis is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. \n\nAs you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and \nacidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.\n\n\n\nDifferences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method\n\nFinally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: \n\n(Reminder: Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is not Cold Brew coffee.) \n\n\nFull Immersion Cold Brew\n\n\nFresh \nCO2 Draft\nNitrogen Draft \nBottled \n\nIce Drip \n\n\nLet's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:\n\nStumptown Draft Cold Brew \n\n\n This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. \n\nStumptown Nitro Cold Brew \n\nThis coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. \n\n\nThe cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! \n\n\n\nUpdate: Very Short Chemical Analysis\n\nHow do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?\n\nIt is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). \n\nAlso, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.\n\nAmino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). \n\nThis article is helpful: Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.\n", "title": ""}

There was however a silver-lining that gave the pre-infusion a redeeming quality: Because of the reduction in brightness, I found that when using really fresh coffee ( &lt; 4 days old), the pre-infusions reduction in brightness took away from the character metallic taste found with fresh coffee.

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.

They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.

This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit.\n\n\nMeasure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess.\nConvert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.\nMultiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.\n\n\nVoila! Provided you are pretty skilled at handling and measuring things, you have an accurate answer. :)\n", "title": ""}

It is called ISSpresso and is the\nbrainchild of two Italian companies \u2014 Argotec and Lavazza \u2014 in\ncollaboration with the Italian Space Agency\nTurin, 13 June 2014 \u2013 \u201cAn espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard\nthe International Space Station.\u201d We have repeatedly heard this\ncomment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at\ntimes working in the International Space Station, and today their\nespresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza\nare working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually\nbring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space\nStation. So in the Futura Mission \u2014 the second long-term mission of\nthe Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station \u2014 another Italian\nastronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha\nCristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into\nspace, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic\nItalian espresso in orbit.\nIts name is ISSpresso. It takes its name from the International Space\nStation (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first\ncapsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions\nof space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of\nliquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.\nISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian\nengineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and\nEuropean leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for\nin-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.\nISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to\ndeliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it\nwas selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in\nthe framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the\nAgency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects\nand activities to be carried out in the ISS.\n\u201cItalian coffee is a beverage without borders \u2014 comments Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President\nof Lavazza \u2014 and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into\nspace for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched\nthe espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by\nThierry Le Gou\u00e8s and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the\ntime may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually\njust a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to\novercome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso \u2014 the\nindisputable symbol of made in Italy products \u2014 on board the\nInternational Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major\nproject with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our\ndivision dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific\nand engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and\nnutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.\u201d\n\u201cOur aerospace engineers \u2014 stated David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec\n\u2014 have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the\nastronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also\nthanks to Lavazza\u2019s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2\nsystems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:\nArgotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra\nhigh-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable\nwith immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological\nchallenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the\nItalian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.\nIn addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of\nthe European astronauts\u2019 training and nutrition. Food provides an\nimportant psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian\nespresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed\nespecially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to\nhome.\u201d\nRoberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:\n\u201cISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS\nnational usage rights available to public-private partnership\ninitiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for\ntechnological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring\nISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements\nwith the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of\nimproving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the\nastronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary\nexploration missions.

A prototype of the space coffee machine is\ncurrently being tested at Argotec\u2019s laboratories and all the necessary\nfunctional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica \u2013\nSelex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at\nlaunching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of\nwhom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The \u2018corner\ncaf\u00e9\u2019 on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,\na sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,\nchatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in\nmissions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a\nvery challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also\nbe able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caff\u00e8 lungo\nor hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can\nalso be rehydrated.\nExtra-terrestrial technology. Every tiniest detail\nof ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering\nchallenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of\nphysics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of\nhandling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space\nenvironment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water\ninside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special\nsteel tube designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The\nmachine is so complex that it weighs about 20 kilograms since there\nare back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in\naccordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space\nAgency. ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project\nwhich, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts\u2019\nmenu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid\ndynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted\nhave led to international patents, which will be useful both for\nfuture space missions and immediate terrestrial use...\n\ntl;dr\nIt looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food.\n\nJust found images on The Guardian:\n\nAnd on http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/\n\n", "title": ""}

Below 18%, and you\u2019re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, \u201cHow much did you get from the grounds?\u201d\n\nStrength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more\u2026 something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you\u2019re in the \u201cheavy, thick\u201d coffee zone. Simply put,\u201cHow much ended up in the cup?\u201d\n\nRatio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, \u201cHow did you get there?\u201d Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they\u2019re finding that they\u2019re using 80 grams or more per liter when they\u2019re making coffee. Is it \u201cwrong\u201d to make coffee at 90 g/L? No\u2026 but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?\n\nFor the assistance of common men like me,\n\n\nThen, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

{"id": "324", "body": "I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly \u00b120% accurate.\n\nFor any amount of \"good strength\" American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.008, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.\n\nWeakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. \n\nThese numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.\n\nExplanation below:\n\nMaximum caffeine content\n\nTypical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)\nthough Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has\nroughly twice that\nmuch. \n\nIf you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.\n\nI use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of\nbeans weighs about 12 grams (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh\nonce and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight\nand volume).\n\n\n\nSo if I eat that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them\nwith any amount of water I will be consuming the 120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine\npresent in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation\nexercise. The strongest or biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with\nthat scoop of beans will have no more than 120mg caffeine. \n\nHow strong is my cup?\n\nTypical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in \n1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%\nconsidered optimal whereas \n\"a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%\"\nsolids\n\nSo 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water\n(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. \n\nOn the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of \"optimal\" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.\n\nSo: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of\nbeans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it \"too weak\" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.\n\nI'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee, or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for \"optimal\" strength American-style brewed coffee is around 0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.\n\nBonus corollary/sanity check\n\nUsing the same method, a shot of espresso made with 7g of ground\ncoffee maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the 64mg/shot reported by the USDA and others also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.\n", "title": ""}

This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.\n\nSecond, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor?

If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.\n\nI roast at home and the only time I have ever \"sorted\" is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.\n\nTo answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.\n", "title": ""}

My understanding is that releasing the gases ahead of time prevent the gasses from interfering with an even extraction throughout the brewing process.\n\nAs when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest.\n\nFrom my own experience, fresher, better-quality coffees tend to produce more gasses.

Basically the way it works is:\n\nGet a load of volunteers\nBy doing questionnaires, work out everything about them\nTrack them over a long period of time\nSee if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers)\n\nAll the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for causation, only for correlation. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.\nThere's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).\nRemember also that medical studies are chronically badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed wildly. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.\nOne tool against all of this uncertainty is meta-analysis. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.\nOne of these was done in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:\n\nAlthough our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results.

{"id": "419", "body": "A moka pot is what some call a stovetop espresso maker; I find this to be a bit of a misnomer, because the result is rather different than proper espresso. Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also this answer). I don't think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either.\n\nA percolator boils water and drips it over grounds continuously.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.\n\nI have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.\n\nI suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.\n\nFull disclosure: this meta question and my answer prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "430", "body": "It seems that the cause of the situation of curdling soya milk in coffee is that the acid from the coffee curdles the proteins and/or fats in the (soya or other) milk, being catalysed by the heat of the coffee; so that's what needs to be mitigated.\nThere are a couple related questions on Cooking.SE, including this one that suggests adding salt to the coffee will help a little (table salt, or even bicarb / baking soda).\nI have tried adding table salt to the coffee first, then adding the coffee to the soya milk, and it seems to help (a little, sometimes; YMMV). Another Cooking.SE question also suggests waiting for coffee to cool.\nThe linked TheKitchn article (linked from the aforementioned previous question and @PythonMaster's answer) suggests that cooling the coffee, or pouring coffee into the soya milk (rather than the other way around) helps via similar mechanisms. In my experience in messing around with this, I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). It absolutely depends on the type of coffee, also, because different coffees will have different degrees of acidity.  See also this table about relative acidity levels.\nHowever, it is certainly the case that adding coffee into the milk will be helpful in general (compare also to tempering of eggs or adding acid into water rather than the other way around).  In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.\nIMHO, I have found the brand (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee.  My only guesses are that\n\nthese compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as carrageenan or xanthan gum) interfere with the coagulation, or\nsomething else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)\n\nI generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.\nFreshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question about storing soya milk in the freezer, where we reached similar conclusions.\nAt the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try:\n\nAdd cold coffee into soya milk.  Does it curdle?  If so, it seems temperature is not your only enemy.\nCheck your label; does it have carrageenan or so?

{"id": "438", "body": "The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be oxidation.\n\nOxidation\n\nChemically, oxidation is defined as the following from this source.\n\n\n  Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons\n  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different\n  compounds.\n\n\nSpecifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:\n\n\n  In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates\n  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)\n  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.\n\n\nOxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.\n\nThe process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. \n\nWhen the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.\n\nThe compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.\n\nLoss of heat\n\nAs the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.\n\nSo no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.\n\nAnswering your final question about duration of freshness:\n\nHow long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.\n\nAs soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.\n\nAs I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. The sooner you drink it the better.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nEnsure there is little to no air left in your flask.

This is done by folding over the two embossed edges. This causes the filter paper to nestle against the edge of the filter and sit deep in the filter insert. This good fit prevents the filter paper from folding in during the brewing process\nAdditional fact: The coffee filter was not invented by Melitta the company, but by Melitta Bentz.\n\nSorry for that bad translation.

{"id": "1526", "body": "99% of the coffee I drink is single origin since I roast my own and don't buy blends.  That being said I also have an Aeropress I use 2 or 3 times a week to make coffee (I use a drip machine or clever dripper the rest of the time).  What I have found is that any coffee I buy/roast that ISN'T recommended as a SO espresso tastes poor to me when brewed with my Aeropress.  I have solved this issue for myself by no longer buying beans that aren't recommended as a SO espresso.  \n\nMy untested hypothesis from this is that most coffees that would not do well as espresso will also not do well as aeropresso.  While the resulting coffee from an Aeropress is not espresso, the brew methods share enough in common and the results are similar enough (not the same, but similar) that they have (my opinion) quite a bit in common with what beans do well when brewed in that manner.\n\nSingle origin versus blended don't mean anything out of the context of how they taste.  It's possible to have a poorly grown and processed single origin that won't be great no matter how it's brewed, but it's still single origin.  It's also possible to find blends that are done so for a variety of bad reasons (to produce a consistent, but not great taste, to reduce costs, etc) or blends that are done for the right reasons (to get a specific taste profile that may not be possible with any single origin, but IS great).  There are great and less than great single origin coffees.  There are also great and less than great blends.  I thing that some folks have biases against blends because in the past they were most often done for cost or consistency reasons and not necessarily for the best flavor. \n\nTL;DR I would likely recommend anything that should be good for espresso (single origin or blend) and high quality as a good candidate for Aeropress brewing.\n", "title": ""}

This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.\n\n\nThe real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.\n\n\nYou can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.\n\n\nThe further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.\n\n\nThis directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required.

Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.\n\n\nBrown filters are just plain without any improvements.

Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the website where all the information of this section came from.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nWell here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:\n\n\n  According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they\u2019re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more \u201cgreen,\u201d compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.\n\n\nPaper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen.

Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.\n\nA blog post contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses the use of deep saucers for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, according to US government legend, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.\n\nFundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like eating peas off the back of one's fork. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.

I haven't found any good references for an explanation; more discussion below.\nIt's easier to see what's happening. Using a bigger pot, it would be more difficult to see when the boiling/foaming is happening.

This one from CoffeeGeek suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And this one doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly state the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. \n\nOther examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:\n\n\nMoka pot. The size of the pot determines how much you brew at a time; can't really make more or less (though you could brew a few pots in a row). See also moka.\nEspresso.

(Edit: to be clear, I chewed on these filters only to see if I taste a difference between rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters, not to somehow \"condition\" the filter before brewing use)\n\n\nMy conclusions:\n\n\nPaper filters taste terrible -- mine anyway -- rinsed or not. I may have to revisit this question on brown versus white filters, buy better paper filters, or use a cloth-filtered Nel pot.\nI wasted a lot of filters doing these tests.\n\n\nIn fact, after using a pre-rinsed filter I got a \"structural failure\" -- the bottom of the filter broke -- when brewing pour-over with a heavily rinsed filter. I'll probably have to eat some better-quality or white paper filters to make this fair.\n\nIn sum, my only conclusion is that quickly rinsing the inside and outside of the filter is the only way for this to have any benefit. I'm discounting any other benefit of pre-rinsing, such as rinsing with hot water would warm ceramic cone filter-holder or pot/mug.\n", "title": "Should I rinse paper coffee filters before use?"}

{"id": "1558", "body": "Let's answer your first question first:\n\nWhat's the best way to rinse a paper filter? Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?\n\nYou can't really rinse only the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks both sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is very accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water\nNow let's answer your second question:\n\nHow does it help?\n\nWell, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.\nAnd now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?):\n\nWhat is being rinsed off?\n\nWell, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.\nBonus Information About Your Experiments:\nLooks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will absolutely not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).\nI hope this helps you!\n", "title": ""}

Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:\n\na traditional espresso machine (See this history of espresso machines and production techniques for one view of what is traditionally espresso), and\ncapsule-based &quot;espresso&quot; systems. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (here's a review of Nespresso and three others). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage.\n\nMy answers:\nNo.\nIn simple point of fact, espresso is not traditionally made with a coffee-filled capsule, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)\nIf you subscribe to the INEI being a benchmark of espresso production standards (PDF), capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example:\n\nquantity of coffee (e.g., Nespresso might be light);\nhot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam);\nSome capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) do produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by using pressure that is too high, or on the other hand too low for extraction and crema. That said, it seems that AeroPress can create crema at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]\n\nMaybe.\nThere have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. One four-subject test gave higher marks to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. This one agrees. Another test disagreed, giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.\nAs you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?\nIt doesn't matter.\nThis is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a consistent result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), what difference does it make if it's &quot;real&quot; espresso or not?\n[1] Is AeroPress espresso?

{"id": "1578", "body": "tl;dr: Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.\n\nUse of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:\n\n\n[1] pretty good pro/con overview from air-n-water (obscure?);\n[2] from World of Caffeine;\n[3] from LiveStrong, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);\n[4] from Melitta, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)\n\n\nFrom those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written a lot of text here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on paper versus metal mesh, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.\n\nMaterial. There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:\n\n\nmetal mesh (stainless steel or \"gold tone\");\nnylon (or other plastic) mesh;\nperforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);\nfabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).\n\n\nAll of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.\n\nOne-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters.\n\nPerformance. Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.\n\nPaper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some good things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.\n\nFlavour. Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.\n\nCost. Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for \"years\" for a few quid ($/\u20ac/\u00a3) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.\n\nClean-up. Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about how often and how much to clean a permanent filter. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.\n\nWaste / environmental issues. I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to rinse your paper filters, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.\n\nMy Conclusion. For my money, personally, I prefer the paper filter:\n\n\nBetter flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);\nConvenience (easier to use and keep clean);\nI compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.\nMarginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).\n\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1586", "body": "There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... practice! And... The most optimal way of tamping depends on every individual pull: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.\n\nUltimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to pack the grounds uniformly. Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a \"slanted\" puck; if your grounds are packed more loosely in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.\n\nThat said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:\n\n\nAdd the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.\n15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this \"by feel\".\nUse a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.\nAim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).\nTwisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for \"polishing\", but not necessary).\n\n\nThen there's some controversial bits:\n\n\n\"Knocking\" is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].\nOn the \"North, South, West, East\" topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is slightly smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't.

Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.\n\nSourness is a perception of acidity.

Sugar reduces the perception of sourness, but it could be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) dissipates more quickly than the sourness (acids), you might be left with \"more sourness than sweetness\" in the aftertaste after some time.

{"id": "1624", "body": "A few other factors to consider:\n\n\nFreshly ground beans.\nHow you store your coffee beans. You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO2. I bought a stack of 250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use AirScape canisters.\nThe water you use. If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.\nThe amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).\nHow vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.\nWhen pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.\nUsing paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.\n\n\nObviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.\n\nWith regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. This video gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.\n\nThe other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]\n\n[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.\n\n[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.\n\n[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?\n\n[4] Known as the Ross Droplet Technique\n", "title": ""}

There is no heating element, so I'm not exactly sure what causes this buildup in the first place.

{"id": "1630", "body": "I am answering here as it applies to Italy, elsewhere it can be different.\n\nCappuccino in Italian means little cappuccio, which in turn means little cap.\nIt is a milk-and-coffee drink with a peculiar topping:  a milk foam obtained with steam. You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.\n\nThe steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. \n\nTemperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.\n\nEspresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.\nContrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.\n\nBesides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. \n\nBig espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.\n\nNote that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.\n\nI have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.\n\nGiven the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  burned, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. \nAnyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.\n\nAs I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. \n\nLatte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.\n\nStrange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all. Perhaps it was in 1800, when the espresso was invented, but now we just say: \"A coffee, please\".   \n", "title": ""}

There will also be tiny particles of ground coffee, small enough to make their way through the filter/basket that holds the original coffee grounds, and these particles act to promote the staining/sedimentation, esp. at the bottom of your carafe.\n\nYou've already seen the first evidence of success when the rinse water came out almost as dark as the brewed coffee the carafe normally holds.  It's large a matter of repetition.  However if the carafe were used to hold some coffee mixed with something else, such as milk or creamer, this can make a more difficult cleaning problem (because the fat in milk will act as a binding agent that resists water solution).  I assume that is not the case here since most people in the office will have their own preferences for adding milk or other creamers, if any.\n\nIt's a bit easier to see how quickly the staining rinses out of a glass carafe (several rinses may be needed, judging by your description of the build-up), but there's nothing about a steel carafe that would make the staining more difficult to remove.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1651", "body": "EDIT: I thought about this more. In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it is interesting!). With just about any selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  \n\nAs an example of drip versus espresso, the Wikipedia article on caffeine (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- this and this) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has slightly more caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (\"standard dose\", from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.\n\nSo, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.\n\n\n\nI agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.\n\nI don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is very soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (citation listed at Wikipedia and here). Yes, those are listed as grams, which means that water could dissolve tens to hundreds of times as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as this and this; also keep in mind that the lethal dose of caffeine is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)\n\nBack to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.\n\nIn general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew lower caffeine content coffee; the point being that the \"other stuff\" (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is very short indeed) you'll get most of the \"other stuff\" but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.\n", "title": ""}

What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the conventional style) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims.\n\nOther (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help \"wick\" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).\n\nContrasting the two types of cones:\n\n\n\nbetween a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the \"wells\" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow \"seals\" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for \"why\" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the \"seal\" and permits the coffee to drain.\n\nAnother way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar \"ridge\" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little \"pleats\" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.\n\nI find that this \"pooling\" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the \"sealing,\" but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.\n\nThe pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.\n", "title": ""}

If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound.\n\nThere's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy. But there are probably others as well. \n\nHere's some comparisons, summarized from the linked articles:\n\n\nYouTube video - milk froth-off. They compare rice, coconut, and almond. They got the best performance with almond milk, coconut did almost as well, and rice milk did not perform well.\nMarkBittman dot com has an article on the search for a vegan cappuccino. It suggests that soy is the best alternative for foam, followed by almond. The text and comments suggest (but doesn't outright state) that hemp works well also.\nThe Peaceful Dumpling article (linked previously in @PythonMaster's answer; summarizing the original article's conclusions here) concludes that soy is best, followed closely by hemp, and that almond doesn't work as well.\n\n\nThe conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based \"milks.\" This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be your best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.\n\nThere's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).\n\nAnother take would be to look at the \"science\" of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  This CoffeeGeek article discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1669", "body": "I'm going to focus on the \"old-school\" aspect of your question.\n\nFrom my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing \"camp coffee\" is a percolator. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a \"stovetop espresso maker\", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some very compact moka pots like this one that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on the difference between a percolator and a moka pot. Those are my preferences for camp coffee.\n\nFor a little more technology, you can use integrated heater/container systems like the JetBoil; they also have small accessories like this French press insert so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, and (separately) use it to make coffee).\n\nOn the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use instant coffee or try coffee bags such as these, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see instructables and MtBoE). Though there are tradeoffs and reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).\n\nStorage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about storage in general and vacuum-sealing. You could always use a hand grinder, but that's more gear and more weight.\n\nIn sum: I go \"fast and light\" for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!\n", "title": ""}
{"id": "1670", "body": "I answered a previous question about making coffee with eggs that might also address your question.  The method is very simple and I see no reason why you couldn't do the same thing without the eggs.  Here is my original answer below:\n\n\n  I don't know any history behind the practice but I learned it myself during a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon back in the early '90's. The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel. Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.\n\n\nYour method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.  A small French press might also suit your needs just fine.  You should test out your method before you go, though.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1673", "body": "I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acidity.\nGenerally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terroir flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.\nSo, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew.\nI.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew. Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.\nDarker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less.\nIn summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a French press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast. Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew. As backwards as it is, I hope this helps!\n", "title": ""}

As it so happens, the origin flavors of roasted coffee fade very quickly (sometimes in as short as a week).  However, the roasting flavors seem to hang around a bit longer.

I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.

{"id": "1713", "body": "Disclaimer: I have no coffee maker designing or manufacturing experience.  This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.\n\nFrom a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. \n\nAssumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) \n\nCoffee Maker Product Landscape\nBased on the above I did some research on food services warehouse and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)\n\n\nOPP: 1000 - 2600\nMPP: 3500 - 4700\nHPP: 6000 - 10,000\n\n\nBelow is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)\n\n\n\nLets assume the following as customer segments\n\n\nOPP: Small office break room coffee machine\nMPP: Large office cafeteria\nHPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts\u2026\n\n\nRequirements Analysis:\nFlow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple\n\n\nOPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr\nMPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr\nHPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr\n\n\nEngineering Analysis\n\nProduct Design\nConsider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.\n\n\n\nProduct Testing, Validation and Manufacturing\nThe cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.\n\nProduct Serviceability and Support\nAn OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  \n\nProduct Pricing VS BOM price -> General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. \n\nReferences:\n\n\nBlue Ocean Strategy \nExample Coffee Maker BOM\nExample Coffee Maker Landscape\nPerformance Improvement Analysis\nCoffee Maker Product Design\nGrindmaster Single brew coffee maker product offering example\n\n", "title": ""}

The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  \n\nFirst, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  \n\nSecondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  \n", "title": ""}

Then, I brew my coffee.

I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.\n\nEventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I slowly backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.

{"id": "1758", "body": "Brewed coffee ages like milk.  As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.\n\nOne flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.\n\nIf waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.

{"id": "1759", "body": "In general, I argue that you shouldn't be able to re-use the grounds. That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. \n\nThat said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests you might want to change other parameters of your brewing. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see this Q/A for what I mean by extraction in this case.\n\nYou could try this experimentally also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)\n\nAs a practical note, you might also consider simply to brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go.

Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.\nThe Taste\nWhile debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process does. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are very picky cats.\nBut, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes very close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).\nConclusion\nDon't raise your expectations too high, it's not really that much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.\nIt tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1791", "body": "Edit 02/26/2016. I am now convinced that resting the beans is necessary. There are just too many roasters I've heard from (on here and in person) that believe it is necessary, and I have seen with my own eyes changes in the appearance of the beans a day after the roast (they seem to darken a bit).\nPreviously (while still unconvinced).\nJohn Snow's and Nathan's answers sound very plausible, but I'm still not convinced that resting fresh-roasted coffee (past the point of cooling) improves its brewed taste. As far as I can tell, no one has ever proven this. DISCLAIMER - I don't want to believe it, because I think brewing after roasting is fun. But I will eventually listen to reason if strong enough arguments present themselves. Below are a couple of points that allow me to remain in disbelief.\nThere's a guy on YouTube claiming the resting fresh-roasted coffee principle is a myth due to a mistaken case of cause and effect from unskilled coffee shop employees. He goes so far as to tell his own myth of a teenage kid (suffering from acne - nice touch) who sees his employer resting the beans and makes the conclusion that they're better after they sit. But really, the employer is letting the coffee rest because it's impossible to brew large amounts of really fresh roasted (it will explode or something) and the teen is just too lazy to ask. He just wants to smoke weed.\nNow if you're not convinced by the explanation above, the only scholarly source I could find is Michael Sivetz's Coffee Processing Technology, Volume 1, where on page 248 he writes,\n\nBeans cannot be ground directly after roasting as they are too soft and would be crushed, flattened, and scarred. When the beans are cool, hard, and brittle, they may be ground.\n\nSo I just have to cool them down? Ok, I may be extrapolating a bit since this book is about getting coffee to the masses. And it's very old.\nFinally, I'm not a scientist, but I just don't see how carbon dioxide escaping from a bean is going to change the flavor of brewed coffee, especially considering the bean is about to be pulverized and soaked in near boiling water.\nEdit 05/13/2021. Someone proposed the following edit. I, Ben, am not a commercial roaster (not even a roaster at all in 2021!), but how could I reject the edit of a real commercial roaster?\nI am also a commercial coffee roaster &amp; although i will admit i 'm not an expert at tasting &amp; cupping while at a Coffee Culture show in London a highly skilled barista next to us claimed our coffee (espresso)  was probably still a bit too fresh( it had degassed for about 48 hours-our boss thinking that fresher the better. He showed us the excess carbon dioxide ( bubbles!) as the coffee was under extraction. We have always known to degas coffee before packing -too fresh &amp; the pack will blow up like a balloon &amp; could burst causing a mess! I'm sure a scientist could give you the reason why excess Co2 in coffee is a bad thing &amp; is best to degas as much out as possible. I can definitely say though from drinking LOTS of coffee that i think most coffees are at their best after after 3 or 4 days if degassing/resting. Also a factor is how old the green beans are because some can sit about in a warehouse for years before sold. Coffee S ience is a thing &amp; you can get lost down the rabbit hole!

Waste of coffee, to be sure.\n\nAlso, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, everything.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a Conical Burr grinder.\n\nConical Burr\n\nBeans move through once.  When you set your burr grinder to a certain fineness, there will be very little heterogeneity in particle size.  (N.B.  Spend more on the grinder, get a more even grind.)  This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.\n\nSome tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:\n\n\nPrices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.\nHow you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.\nThe under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.\nConsistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.  Why hobble your good machine with sub-par ingredients?\n\n", "title": ""}

Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.\n\nUnderstanding Permanent versus Paper filters\n\nA permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.\n\nAn impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.\n\nDrip Coffee\n\nDrip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.\n\nA paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.\n\nFlat-bottom filters:\n\n\n\nCone shaped filter:\n\n\n\nThe permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.\n\n\n\nSingle Cup\n\nThese filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.\n\nFrench (Push) Press\n\nA french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.\n\nThe Parts of a French Press Filter:\n\n\n\nEspresso Machine\n\nAn espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.\n\nThere are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.\n\n\nSingle wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.\nDouble wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.\nPod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.\n\n\nPortafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:\n\n\n\nThe filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.\n", "title": ""}

If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.\nThe machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).\n\n\n\n\nCAUTION:\n\nAs I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. \n\nThis is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. \n\nJust be smart about it.

{"id": "1885", "body": "I think there are 2 questions here. The first is why oil and water don't mix. The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. \n\nFirst question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. \n\nThe second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.\n", "title": ""}

Specifically, by loading the basket so heavily that it pushes up against the shower screen. \n\nIf I use a double shot basket, I have to load 21+ grams to get the extraction down to a brew ratio of 2:3. Basically, I have to get it to the point where I'm struggling to insert the portafilter, otherwise the extraction speed is just incredibly fast. At the recommended starting point for the Vario grinder for espresso, (2Q), it takes about 7 seconds for an extraction using 16 grams of coffee in a double basket.\n\nIf I stick to the recommended doses, and give the coffee some headroom from the shower screen, I end up having to use the finest possible setting (1A - 1E) on my grinder to 'slow the flow'. This results in extremely overextracted tasting coffee, which makes sense because the grind is like powdered sugar at that point.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n", "title": "Espresso - Dose affecting extraction time disproportionately"}
{"id": "1918", "body": "When I hear \"cold brew\" I think something like Dutch Coffee, or coffee brewed with cold water and long extraction times. Acidity likely wouldn't be reduced by cooling the coffee directly after, it's possible that the melted ice is just diluting your brew and cooler temperature mellows out the taste of the acidity.\n\nThere are many ways of cold brewing. Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy. Others slowly drip cold water or ice melt into grounds using a drip tower. The second method is often prefered and offers the most balanced extraction. However, I've had Toddy before and it does alright. Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.\n\nIf you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap). You can brew a cup when you want it, rather than prepping coffee ahead of time.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1920", "body": "I believe there is mysticism to blooming. Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.\n\nYou should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).\n\nI think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.\n\nThe bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "1922", "body": "From what I can tell, you're grind is rather coarse for a pour-over. You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.\n\nPeople are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.\n\nAn example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).\n\nI'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.\n\nMost of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.\n\nMy recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.\n\nAs far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.\n\nTry a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.\n", "title": ""}

Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.\n\nIt might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called \"dutch coffee\", where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.\n\nAs far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.\n\nCheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the \"dolce\" or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.\n\nI think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful.

{"id": "1934", "body": "As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.\nAs for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.\nUPDATE:\nSomething I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water.

Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.\nCleaning\nOf course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and &quot;wetness&quot; from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with &quot;bumping&quot; so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).\n*especially under the basket.\nCalibrating\nThe abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak.\n\nhttp://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html\nTo fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls.\n\nFrob. In the frob pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't aimless.)\nTwiddle. In the twiddle pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.\nTweak. In the tweak pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.\n\nThe controls we have available are the grind, dose, and water quantity. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be constant. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.\nIn the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your base dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.\nSet the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.\nIf the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.\nSo, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.\nThen do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.\nThere should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot.\nNow, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop just before the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.\nAdjusting on-the-fly\nRemember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.\nThe same three adjustments, frob, twiddle, and tweak, apply also to dynamic adjustments. Frob, the coarsest control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. Twiddle, the medium-grain control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. Tweak, the finest control is the dose.\nIf a shot pulls 1-second too long, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.\nIf a shot pulls 1-second too short, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.\nIf the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), twiddle the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same density with more mass.\nIf the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), twiddle the grind a little finer so you can achieve the density with less mass. (Volume is constant.)\n \nI actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.\nOn a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.\nThat's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.\n--\nAppendix: The &quot;David Schomer&quot; method or &quot;ritual&quot;\nThis is what I remember from the amazing book, Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques by David Schomer.

Or better, calmly explain that it's the obvious thing to do to get back on track. Unpredictable shots == unpredictable drink production times. \n\nIf you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. \n\nSuper-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the \"oatmeal bowl problem\". If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.\n\nExtending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl... You wash the bowl first ... right?\n\nBreak it down.\n\nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.\nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.\nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  \n\nI repeat:\nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  \n\nWhile it's pilling, you can soak the steam wand (all the way up past the holes at the top, tube removed.), and remove the hoppers and vacuum the grinders. \n\nWipe out the oils from the grinders with a napkin or paper towel (no water up there!)\n\nWhen it's done pilling, you can take the drawer and the tray and the spout to wash.\n\nVacuum and/or wipe grounds from the carcass and reach up with a towel and clean the two ribs.\n\nThen, clean the heart. Just between the ribs there are two circles, one on your side and one a few inches away on the other side. With a towel, wipe any crusty stuff from the edges of the two circles. These are the two halves which come together to form the brewing chamber, the crucible of the alchemy.\n\nIf you really want to treat your machine (maybe it's the machine's birthday), give it another pill before bringing it back up. Blast out the steam till it's nice and dry. Scrape and remove all the milk residue until its just shiny shiny metal. Bottle-brush the steam tube.\n\nDeep-cleaning the steam wands\n\nThen give its buddy some love.\n\nCalibrating.\n\nI'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. \n\nEach programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print \"adjust grind coarser\" or \"adjust grind finer\" on the screen. So, the machine only \"sees\" a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) \"too much inconsistency\". Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel. (You can still queue shots but pressing Cancel to switch back to normal view will also remove the last queued shot just as it does on normal view.)\n\nIf the numbers are \"too inconsistent\" (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.\n\nAlright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks coarser than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to caking in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual \"death-spiral\" of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.\n\nIf it's acting really bad, you may need to go more-than-a-few clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official \"10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change\" that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.\n\nSo, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. \n\nIt takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.\n\nHow to know if you've gone coarse enough\n\nThe signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that didn't \"catch\" on the old machines.\n\nRun of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.\n\nCross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind\n\nIf you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.\n\nThe procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.\n\nAlways, always, always, calibrate from the coarse side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.\n\nAdjusting on the fly\n\nI posted this idea some years ago in facebook.\n\n\n  I've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.\n   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber is\n   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulate\n   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,\n   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.\n  \n  So, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.\n   You can:\n   Before the first shot, click it finer.\n   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.\n   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser. This is your\n   \"cruise\" setting.\n  \n  Larger flakes should act more like \"fiber\" and keep the chamber scrubbed. But you need to go finer at the start to compensate for lower temperature.\n  \n  If it's been a long time (>15 minutes), then your first pair are not only\n   cold but stale. If it's your mom, don't serve her those shots.\n  \n  Unlike the Verismos (and the Astorias, too, for that matter), these \n   Mastrenas seem to have a very small doser so the effect of grind-change \n   is quite rapid. This first pair will be a blend of the old setting and the new. \n   The second pair is most or all fresh ground.\n\n\nUnresolved issues\n\nThe triple shot button. Right now on one machine we have the single part grinding longer than the double part, and I don't know how to get them untwisted.\n\nPiston/Position/Powder Errors\n\nCall Service! But also, try this until they get there:\n\n\nCross your fingers.\nPull a decaf single.\nRinse.\nThrow a pinch of cinnamon over your shoulder.\nRinse again.\nPull a half-caff double.\nRinse again.\nSee \"Emergency recalib, above.\n\n\n[n.b This is not official Starbucks policy, but my own private theory developed over the past 10 years of working with this machine (and its predecessor the Verismo).

{"id": "1950", "body": "The Grind\n\nThe goal for grinding coffee is consistency of the grind, everything should be relatively the same size so it extracts evenly. In coffee grinding parlance, \"boulders\" is used to describe chunks and \"fines\" is used to describe microfine particles. When you introduce water (in any extraction method), the \"fines\" give up their flavor quickly, adding bitterness when overextracted, and the boulders hardly give up anything at all, leaving a thin and sour underextracted flavor. \n\nA burr grinder with two mounted bearings (top and bottom) is the best tool for consistent grinding due to the absence of \"burr wobble\" seen in cheaper burr grinders.\n\nThe Resulting Brew\n\nA sediment layer comes from the fines making their way through the metal screen on the press. Ideally, your goal should be zero fines for your French Press brew. A coffee hack you can do to get around this is to shake your freshly ground coarse coffee in a small metal sieve so the fines fall through.

I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is \"clogged\" in this way.

Almost completely opaque. The Chemex filter page states that they are \"20-30% heavier\" than other filters and removes finer sediment and \"undesirable oils and fats\".\nThe Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The Melitta brand filters have claimed \"flavor enhancing perforations.\"\nThe Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method.

For example, try brewing coffee at 80\u00b0C / 175\u00b0F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96\u00b0C / 205\u00b0F water.\n\nWith my technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure. It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.\n\nRate of pouring the water. This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final \"drainage\" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the output at a steady rate. The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).\n\nAll that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.\n\nYou may also want to consider rinsing your filter, and see more about wetting the grounds for coffee bloom.\n", "title": ""}

And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescaf\u00e9 or Eight O'Clock or Caf\u00e9 du Monde or ...)?\n\nIn fact, a mass-market coffee like this might benefit from AeroPress treatment. For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of Robusta beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. Robusta produces more crema in espresso, and might be a way to get more crema from AeroPress. Robusta also has slightly more caffeine than Arabica, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, you might reduce a bit of the bitterness sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).\n\nThere might be a few problems, though. First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like Maxwell House is rather course for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from Home-Barista and Bunn). Second, if there are other \"stuff\" in the coffee (e.g., \"Folgers Crystals\" or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.\n\nBut give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.\n", "title": ""}

{"id": "2039", "body": "Great find! How fun. You do indeed have a vacuum coffee maker -- a.k.a. vac-pot, syphon, or siphon.\n\nThis style of vac-pot is intended to be used on a stove-top (specifically: having a flat bottom, and with a handle on the neck of the bottom part -- the \"bulb\") -- looks a lot like this current model from Bodum - c/o Amazon. There's a good primer on the history and types of vac-pot at WeCraveCoffee with some good pictures.\n\nHowever, in general, glass pots are generally not recommended on flat glass-ceramic cooktops for a couple of reasons: they can scratch or otherwise damage each other, and the poor conductivity of glass makes glass-on-glass heating less efficient. More info on this from a question on Seasoned Advice, and recommendations from GE Appliances for their own stovetops. I did see some products such as this one that depicted glass vac-pots on glass-ceramic cooktops. If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it should be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a gas flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your \"mileage\" may vary.\n\nFor a more \"DIY\" adventure as you suggest, consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source. Other styles of vac-pot (such as this Hario model - c/o Amazon) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from Blue Bottle, Stumptown, CoffeeGeek, and many others). Warning: this may remind you of Chemistry lab from School. ;-) And of course be careful with fire.\n\n\n\nSeparately, just for completeness...\n\nIt also looks like you're missing the filter piece. These are inexpensive (relative to the whole apparatus) and you'll want to purchase a new, compatible one anyway (see also another question on siphon filter replacement). \n\nAnother thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades.

Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a direct answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need.\n\nIf you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds. \n\nTo eliminate fine grit, wrap a paper coffee filter over the strainer, and press immediately to achieve 45second extraction, as there will be more resistance with the added filter. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this.

Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups.\n\nRelated to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup.\n\nCoffee oils make it to the news from time to time.

Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic failure of the Bialetti design.

The \"care\" page for Bialetti (follow that link, then click on the \"Care Use\" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to dry thoroughly and most tellingly \"Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation.\" Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. \n\nStandard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone.

Buy a newer version with high heat resistant if the metal is melting too easily. Really it sounds to me that the cevze is a little too old and has been used too much so it is probably best to buy a new cevze in this case. \n", "title": ""}

{"id": "2075", "body": "The amount of caffeine in your cup will depend, as with any method, on the extraction time. It also depends on everything else, e.g. the grind, temperature of the water, but I can't find any information on what these typically are for Balinese coffee, so I'm going to assume they're the same.\n\nAssuming you're using the same coffee with each method, the main thing that will vary is the extraction time. With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself.\n\nFor Balinese coffee, there is no control. If you mix the coffee and water directly, the only thing limiting the extraction time is how long you wait before drinking it.\n\nHowever, having said that, caffeine is actually extracted rather quickly. This study finds that routine percolation removes almost all soluble caffeine. However, the extended extraction time for Balinese coffee is likely to make a bitter brew.\n\nIn conclusion, no, you won't get more caffeine in Balinese coffee compared to filter. Both methods will remove almost all caffeine from the coffee.\n", "title": ""}

Well that depends on how much coffee you are drinking as espresso is served in smaller portions.\n\nThere's no such thing as Espresso Lungo, it's actually just called Lungo. Another Italian coffee, this coffee is and is brewed by:\n\n\n  Lungo is Italian for 'long', and refers to the coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian style coffee - short black with much more water, resulting in a stretched coffee, a lungo. \n\n\nNow don't be fooled by this as to make this coffee, you need an espresso machine\nto make this creation. You just need more-than-normal amount of water and short black (single or double dose or shot). This coffee will have less caffeine than the above coffee types.\n\nRistretto is more of the opposite of Lungo. It uses regular ground coffee with less-than-normal amount of water:\n\n\n  Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water...  The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. \n\n\nIt is also Italian and literally the opposite of a Lungo. It also has less caffeine than American or espresso since it only uses a short shot of espresso and regular ground coffee, similar to Lungo.\n\nSo, American and espresso have the highest caffeine content out of the four, and Lungo and Ristrtto have less caffeine than the above. I would say that espresso has the highest of all in fact but American still looks pretty high in caffeine too.\n", "title": ""}

At the lower end of the price range (under $100), this generally means ceramic burr grinders.  The $10 blade grinders from Walmart can't really give an even grind.

{"id": "2079", "body": "There have been articles in the news about coffee rust affecting coffee crops in many places. After reading this article it dawned on me that not only is C.liberica (resistant to rust) being exported in large quantities from some places (Phillipines, for example), Colombian researchers have developed resistant hybrids that may well be replacing C. arabica--to some extent-- in South America as well. \n\nIf I go to my local coffee place and get a (relatively) expensive espresso my assumption is that the beans are arabica unless otherwise indicated. If you look at a futures contract for coffee, there is a big premium for coffee from certain countries, in part because it is assumed to be arabica.

So in conclusion, it's safe to use paper towels with no risk or worry! But I'll answer your concerns for you.\n\nSince when do paper towels need dye? They're white, so no need for artificial colors here, all they need is some machine to make the cool patterns and all the other cool stuff. Same goes for chemicals. Read the comments for that answer for more information about chemicals that may be inside the paper towel. White paper towels are usually the ones with the lowest chemical content compared to other colored paper towels. \n\nAccording to the comments, brown paper towels will make your coffee taste like one. Not good at all. Bleached towels should be avoided as they contain bleach or CI (chlorine). And who knows what hidden chemicals could be used in the non-bleached ones, any from A-Z really. So use the paper towels with caution as you might be drinking bleached coffee instead...\n\nDepending on how strong your paper towel is, the strength of your coffee will vary.
